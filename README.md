# Fast starter

It is a project whose goal is to compete with Flip Starter, but for the smartBCH network, which gives huge and unlimited possibilities.

## frontend

### Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).

## status

The project is almost halted due to the developer's inability to financially follow it

If someone wants to complete the development, the project needs a website with a tool for uploading smart contracts
